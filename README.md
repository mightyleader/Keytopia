#Keytopia

###What is Keytopia?
It's a sample iOS project, written in Objective-C to investigate best practices in:

- showing and hiding keyboards
- providing input accessory views for text input for messaging apps
- seperating data models from view controllers and persistence stores

It's intended to be a place for me to build an improved system for eventual inclusion in my LocalTalk app. As with any open project, feedback is welcome.
